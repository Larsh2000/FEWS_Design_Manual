# Overview

The FEWS Design Manual provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) in small urban areas 
across Africa. This manual covers the entire process, from problem definition up to the implementation. It leverages GPS 
measurements, hydraulic data, and a HEC-RAS model to ensure effective flood monitoring and response.

## Key Features
* **GPS Installation Guide:** </br>
  Detailed instructions on installing and managing GPS sensors for flood monitoring.

* **Data Processor Package:** </br>
  A Python package for processing sensor data efficiently.

* **HEC-RAS Modelling:** </br>
  Guidelines for setting up HEC-RAS models for flood simulation and risk assessment.

## Installation
There is **no required installation** for the manual itself. However, if users wish to utilize the recommended software tools 
(e.g., GPS processing software, Python packages, or HEC-RAS), they should install these separately. Installation instructions 
for the individual tools are included where necessary in the manual.

## Usage
* **Follow the Manual:**
  The main manual guides the user step-by-step through the setup process of a FEWS. 
* **Reference Case â€“ Narok Town, Kenya:** </br>
  A completed version of the manual for Narok Town, Kenya is included. This can serve as an example or provide additional
  insights for similar setups.

## Future Work
The FEWS Design Manual is a work in progress. There are many promising directions to explore and expand upon. Users are 
encouraged to use this manual as a starting point for designing complete FEWS solutions in their regions or enhancing the 
current workflow.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to contributors and organizations involved in providing input for the manual.
We hope this project can serve as a valuable resource for flood risk mitigation in urban areas.
